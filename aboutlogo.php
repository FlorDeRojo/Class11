<h1>&nbsp;About Our Company Logo</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are made it here thank you for reading our About Us Page! Your support is appreciated!
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agencia Flor de Maga is a booking agency based in Puerto Rico, and one of the best things here is the captivating sight. 
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees, the beaches, the mountains, and let's not get started on the flowers. Well...maybe we should. 
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our company logo is actually the Puerto Rican national flower, Flor de Maga, which also explains the name.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fun facts of the Flor de Maga is that the flower is related to the hibiscus flower, can
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grow upwards of 65 feet tall and symbolizes Puerto Rico's bravery and resilience.</p>
